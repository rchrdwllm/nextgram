# Nextgram - Instagram Clone (WIP)

This is a WIP [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that I'm working on to learn Next.js and TypeScript. It's a clone of Instagram, with its basic functionalities.

There are still a lot of missing stuff that I want to work on. For now, this only looks best on screens small screens as I prioritized working on the mobile experience first.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
